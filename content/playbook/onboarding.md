How We Work
===

2.1 Tools
---
We leverage the following tools to stay organized and efficient with our projects.

### Github 
Github will serve as a repository of all ESC's projects. Individual tasks will be delegated and tracked "issues" on GitHub. You can access our public github organization [here](https://github.com/elonsoc/).

### Discord
ESC uses Discord to communicate, give quick updates, or have virtual meetings. Our members are expected to regularly check messages and respond promptly. Efficient communication is critical to our project's success. To join our Discord, you must be a member of our Phoenix Connect page which you can request membership [here](https://elon.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/elonsocietyofcomputing). Once approved, ping [Jumar Martin](mailto:jmartin57@elon.edu) or [Kai Bilotta](mailto:kbi9lotta@elon.edu) for an invite.


3.1 Meetings
---
### General ESC Meetings
Every Wednesday at 6:30 in Duke 101, we will meet to discuss overall project updates, socialize, and network with industry professionals.

### Competitive Programming Team
We've teamed up with Dr. Spurlock and his competitive programming endeavors to create ESC's own competitive programming team. Every Thursday in Duke starting at 4:15pm, Dr. Spurlock will lead the meeting in preparation for contests across the state.

### Project Team Meetings
Team meetings happen regularly to discuss project-specific tasks and updates. Your respective project lead will determine which time to meet and whether such meetings will be virtual or in-person.
